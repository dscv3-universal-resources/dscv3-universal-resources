# dscv3-universal-resources

## Overview

This project provides Microsoft Desired State Configuration (DSC) v3 resources in various programming language. Microsoft DSC is a management framework that enables declarative configuration for software services and the environment in which these service run.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to showcase different DSC v3 resources and their implementation using the programming language of choice. DSC v3 allows you to write any DSC resource in the programming language you prefer. By creating different DSC v3 resources in these programming languages, we aim to accelerate the adoption of DSC v3 across diverse technical environments and teams with varying language preferences.

## Structure

The repository contains DSC v3 resources with different implementations, which can be used to manage configuration settings across different environments. Each resource follows the DSC v3 schemantics and can be integrated with the engine. You will find the resources under the `resources` folder.
